# Fantasy FPL App

This project is a starter template for building a Fantasy Football app for your FPL mini league.
It consists of:

- `mobile/`: A React Native project for the app.
- `backend/`: A Node.js backend that fetches league data from FPL.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) (for React Native)
- Git

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd fantasy-fpl-app
```

### 2. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

### 3. Start the Mobile App

Open a new terminal:

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx expo start
```

Follow the prompts to run the app on your phone (Expo makes this easy!).

## Next Steps

- Edit and expand the app in `mobile/`
- Expand data fetching in `backend/`
